**Effective Date:** September 26, 2024

## Your Privacy Matters

At Open Mushaf, we take your privacy seriously. This policy explains our approach to privacy and data collection in the app.

## What Information Do We Collect?

Open Mushaf **does not collect any personal information** or any other data from users. The app runs completely offline, and no data is transmitted from your device.

**Why Do We Not Collect Data?**

Our primary goal is to provide a seamless, offline experience for users. Since the app functions offline, there is no need to collect any data for analytics, performance monitoring, or any other purpose.

## We Respect Your Child's Privacy

Open Mushaf is designed for children aged 6 and above who can read Arabic. We are committed to protecting children's privacy. Since our app does not collect any data, children's information is completely safe.

## Keeping Your Data Secure

Since we do not collect any data, there is no personal information to protect. However, we still prioritize app security to ensure a safe user experience by regularly monitoring the app for potential vulnerabilities.

## We Don't Share Your Data

As Open Mushaf collects no data, there is nothing to share with third parties. Your privacy is fully protected.

## Your Privacy Rights

Since no personal data is collected, there is no need for data deletion requests or management of personal information within the app.

## Third-Party Services

Open Mushaf does not use any third-party services for analytics, tracking, or data collection. The app runs entirely on your device without sending any information externally.

## Updates to this Policy

We may update this policy periodically. If significant changes are made, we will notify users within the app. Continued use of the app signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.
